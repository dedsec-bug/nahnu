# nahnu

Reference for this project 
https://blog.cobalt.io/pentest-workflow-leveraging-community-powered-tools-979b54df5e52

I have created this automated script using bash script and automated 3 tools to work together:

1. Naabu : https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu
2. HTTPX : https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx
3. Nuclei : https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei
4. Notify : https://github.com/projectdiscovery/notify

There are 2 files (install.sh | nahnu.sh) 

First run install.sh and install all the required tools in your system then run nahnu.sh and make sure to have a cidr.txt file in the same directory where this tools is installed.
